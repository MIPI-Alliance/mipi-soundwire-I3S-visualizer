Running the command

#> python3 testsuite.py

under the directory tests/ invokes swi3s_visualizer.py for all the configuration files
in tests/test_cfgs in batch mode.
Output JSONs are put under tests/test_out/, that must not exist, so the advice is to run
the regression this way:

#> rmdir test_out/ && python3 testsuite.py

TODO: 
 - better path handling (does not work if the structure under test_cfgs is not flat)
 - comparison between test output and reference is not implemented
 - it would be useful to be able to run the test for only a selected number of configurations
